# RPS-Multiplayer
An interactive two-player platform that allows Rock, Paper, Scissors to come alive.

# About
This J-Query based application allows two users to play against one another. The game follows straightforward rock paper scissors rules. Users' stats, choices, and chat messages are tracked and updated in realtime via Firebase. I took this project as an exercise in extending and hardening my skills with Firebase. This focus for this project was functionality and usability for the players.

# How To Play
To start the game, Player 1 will make a selection and Player 2 will follow. Statistic are kept on file via Firebase to enhance the user-experience. A reload of the page will proxy past opponents high scores to add history and continuity.
